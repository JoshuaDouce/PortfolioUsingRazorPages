<h1>Activities and Interests</h1>
<p>I enjoy going to the coast and the countryside with my girlfriend with our two cockapoos on weekends as well as taking short city breaks when we can. 
    I enjoy reading, especially on train journeys too and from work as it gives me an opportunity to expand my knowledge in the field or just enjoy a good book. 
    I enjoy creating small applications in my own particular web apis or android applications as well as a tendency to play around with 
    Machine Learning libraries such as Google's Tensorflow.</p>
